/*
  Exercise 1: Basic trait

  trait Encryptor and Decryptor form a cipher system.
  Both take an upper case alphabet ('A'-'Z') and return a ciphered or deciphered upper case alphabet.

  Implement encrypt(s: String): (String, Encryptor) using encrypt(c: Char): (Char, Encryptor)
  also implement decrypt(s: String) by decrypt(c: Char)
